# Adam's Weather Dashboard

Creation of a Weather Dashboard that allows a user to check the weather forecast for a designated city.

## Project Goal

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

WHEN I search for a city

THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city

THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city

THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

WHEN I click on a city in the search history

THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Goal Fulfillment

When the user searched for a city then they are presented with current and future weather conditions, up to 5 days in the future

When the user views current weather for a city they are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of the weather, the temperature, the humidity,

and the wind speed

Following an initial search, when the user hovers over the search bar they are presented with a dropdown menu of past searches and are able to click on those searches

to retrieve information on weather for those cities
